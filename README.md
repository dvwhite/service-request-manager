The service industries (such as teaching, hospitality, and healthcare, to name a few) need software to manage the volumne of service requests from their customers in a scale-able and efficient manner that is also satisfactory to the customer. A service request manager is essential to tracking, dispatching, and coordinating resources to service requests. Even other industries providing support or repair services can benefit from this model since they also receive service requests. 

You'll like this project if you work with service requests in some way, and want to track, coordinate or dispatch resources to requests, and open or close a service ticket.

## Goals of this project

### Ease of Use
The user experience and interface should be easy to use, efficient, and as enjoyable as possible. A simplified interface is also easy to both learn and train users to operate.

### Maintainability
To design and develop the project to make adding a feature much easier, since many service operations require a high degree of customization.

## Planned Features

### Request List
An interactive list of requests for the given date

### Single Request View
A modal that enables you to view, edit, save and delete a service request

### Request Age Tracker
Track the time since a request has been made, and optionally, change request state or appearance based on time-based information

### Request Reminders
Set a reminder to review a request at a later date or time

### Resource Dashboard
See a dashboard of allocated and available resources, including countdown timers for when the resource is expected to be free

### Prioritization Rules
Create a prioritization system that can be used to sort, flag or categorize requests, and can also tie into the reminder system
