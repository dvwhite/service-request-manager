# Service Request Manager
## David White
## Project start date: 1/11/2020

The service industries (such as teaching, hospitality, and healthcare, to name a few) need software to manage the volume of service requests from their customers in a scaleable and efficient manner that is also satisfactory to the customer. Request management software is essential to tracking, dispatching, and coordinating resources to service requests. Other industries providing support or repair services could also benefit from this model, since they also receive service requests or an analogue. 

You'll like this project if you work with service requests in some fashion, and want to track, coordinate or dispatch resources to requests, and open or close a service ticket.

## Goals of this project

### Ease of Use
The user experience and interface should be easy to use, efficient, and as enjoyable as possible. A simplified interface is also easy to both learn and train users to operate.

### Maintainability
To design and develop the project to make adding a feature much easier, since many service operations require a high degree of customization.


## Planned Features

### Request List
An interactive list of requests for the given date

### Single Request Viewer
A modal that enables you to view, edit, save and delete a service request

### Request Age Tracker
Track the time since a request has been made, and optionally, change request state or appearance based on time-based information

### Request Reminder
Set a reminder to review a request at a later date or time

### Resource Dashboard
See a dashboard of allocated and available resources, including countdown timers for when the resource is expected to be free

### Prioritization Rules
Create a prioritization system that can be used to sort, flag or categorize requests, and can also tie into the reminder system


## Tools Used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
